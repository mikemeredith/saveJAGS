CHANGES in 0.0.4 (2020-05-10)

  * 'recoverSaves' can now cope with '_' in 'fileStub'.

  * Fixed bugs in 'summary' due to integer overflow and showing KB instead of GB.

  * Improvements to outputs of 'summary'.

  * Added method to convert file list to 'mcmcOutput' class; package now depends on 'mcmcOutput' package.

  * Replaced 'combineSaves' with a method for 'as.mcmc.list'

  * 'saveJAGS' now works with missing or NULL inits.

  * Chain identifiers changed to 2-letter combinations, AA to ZZ; limit of 26 chains raised to 26^2 = 676 (wish of Wyatt Petersen).

  * Improved reporting of JAGS errors.
  _not fully tested_, need JAGS to throw errors for that.

  * Default for 'fileStub' removed, user must specify path.

  * 'summary.saveJAGSfileList' reports if adaptation was adequate and shows median time taken to create a file.

  * added functions 'getModel' and 'getData' to get information on the run.

  * 'combineSaves' gains a 'cores' argument and allows parallel processing.

  * fixed bug in 'combineSaves' when used after 'resumeJAGS'

  * 'summary.saveJAGSfileList' now returns a vector with the base names.

  * added 'resumeJAGS' function.

  * file IDs now use 3 digits with leading zeros

  * 'recoverSaves' checks for duplicate A_1 or A_001 files and ensures chains are same length

  * file lists produced by `saveJAGS` and `recoverSaves` have class `saveJAGSfileList`; there is a `summary` method for this.

  * `saveJAGS` uses the Lecuyer random number generator.

  * `combineSaves` gains `params` and `thin` arguments

  * Changed names from `dump...` to `save...`

  * `simsList` can now deal with ragged arrays
